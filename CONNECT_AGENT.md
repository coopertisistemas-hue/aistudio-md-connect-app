## Before Any Action In This Repository

The following steps are **mandatory** before executing any task, writing any code,
running any command, or making any commit in this repository.

### Step 1 - Load Global CONNECT Standards

Load and follow ALL rules from:

    C:\Users\jafsa\.connect

Required files (ALL must be read and enforced):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| CONNECT_GUARDRAILS.md | STOP rules, WARN rules, ALWAYS rules |
| CONNECT_WORKFLOW.md | Sprint phases, surgical change policy |
| CONNECT_QA_GATES.md | 7-gate QA checklist before every commit |
| CONNECT_I18N_STANDARD.md | PT/EN/ES i18n mandatory from v1 |
| CONNECT_SUPABASE_RLS_FIRST.md | RLS-always-on, Edge Functions only |
| CONNECT_UI_PREMIUM_RULES.md | Premium UI consistency rules |
| CONNECT_COMMIT_STANDARD.md | Conventional commits, pre-commit gates |
| CONNECT_PROMPT_TEMPLATES.md | Required session output format |

### Step 2 - Verify Global Folder Is Accessible

Before proceeding with any task, verify the global folder exists.
If it cannot be accessed:

    STOP - CONNECT Global Standards Unavailable
    Do NOT proceed with any task.
    Report this condition to the operator and await resolution.

### Step 3 - Apply Connect Guardrails to ALL Operations

Every operation in this repository is subject to:

#### STOP Rules (Immediate Halt)
- STOP-01: Prod/staging environment mismatch without migration plan
- STOP-02: Destructive commands (DROP, TRUNCATE, rm -rf, force-push) without explicit approval
- STOP-03: pnpm build fails before commit
- STOP-04: RLS disabled on any table
- STOP-05: Direct frontend client access to sensitive DB tables
- STOP-06: Hardcoded untranslated user-facing strings

#### Always Rules
- Read files before modifying them
- Surgical minimal changes only - no speculative edits
- pnpm build must pass before every commit
- git status must be reviewed before git add
- Session must end with Template 3 report (see CONNECT_PROMPT_TEMPLATES.md)
